# declare the variable

1.var
2.let
3.const

# var was not used widely after introduction of the let in es15
# we can declare a variable after using it
but it was first form of declaration

# let
# similar to the var it should be declared for a variable
# we have to initialize the variable before initializing it


# naming convention
// - only letters,numbers,underscores and dollar signs
// - cant start with the numbers


variable name convention

firstName is an camelcase
<!-- used in the javascrip -->

FirstName is an pascalcase
first_name is an underscore
firstname is a lowercase

# comming to the const we cannot leave a variable just by declaring  it as it is,we should assign some value to it


console.log("Adithya Sai");
